For each integer in arrayB, check if it is the first integer of arrayA.

If the first integer of arrayA is present in arrayB, check if the next integer in arrayB is the same as the second integer in arrayA.

Check each subsequent integer in arrayB against the next integer in arrayA, until the end of arrayA.

If the end of arrayA is reached, print "array A is present in array B".

Otherwise, print "array A is not present in array B".
