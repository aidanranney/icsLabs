Snowboarding Styles

Different Snowboarding styles have different fans. While others would claim that one style is better than the other, we wouldn't make that claim but instead show you the different styles in this article. You can check this article for more information.

Once you have evolved from a beginner to a more experienced boarder, you may want to choose a distinctive riding style and adjust your gear according to that choice. The riding style you prefer will definitely help determine the type of board you should buy. Although riding styles in Snowboarding have many subclasses, there are mainly three riding styles - Freestyle, Freeride, and Freecarve. For a detailed description of each Riding Styles, click any of the links below:

Freeride  (link to freeride page)
Freecarve (link to freecarve page)

Most boards are under one of these categories. Then again, some beginner boards can be a combination of Freestyle and Freeride. 
Still, it is best to choose a board that will fit your style as soon as possible instead of learning a particular style on a combination board. 
Many Snowboarders learn how to ride on a FreeRide/FreeStyle board and then choose either one of these styles. 
FreeCarving is often selected by more experienced FreeRide boarders. 
After you have decided on your ability and riding style, we can move on to the most important board buying decisions - board length and width.
