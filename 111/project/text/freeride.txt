Snowboarding Styles - Freeriding

Freeriding, also known as "all-mountain Snowboarding", is about mastering an all-round style that will give you the freedom to ride, carve, and jump on any terrain, without focusing on technical tricks or speed. In this Snowboarding Style, you will spend most of your time on the ground and you will be able to utilize all the mountain could offer - from open terrain, backcountry chutes, to fresh powder and trees. 

It is also suitable for beginners to start with the Freeriding style because its only focus is on enjoying the ride and exploring all there is on a mountain. 

Usually, the pieces of equipment needed in Freeriding are Soft Snowboard Boots, plate bindings, and Strap or Flow-In Bindings. If you still haven't decided on what kind of terrain you like or is most comfortable in, this style is best for you. As the name suggests, feel free to ride. 

Most Snowboards that you will find in shops and slopes are Freeriding Snowboards. These characteristics will be able to help you differentiate a Freeriding board from other types: 

Relatively longer boards with narrower width, deeper side cut, and more directional in their shape
More often than not, the nose will be longer and the stance of the riders will be slightly positioned towards the rear of the board to make it easier to hang back when riding deep powder.

It may seem awkward the first time you experience Freeriding, as you will have to explore the natural terrain of the mountain. It would be a series of falling, tumbling down, and getting up. Once you get out of the frustration stage, you will soon realize that it's all worth it. Have an exciting Freeriding experience!
