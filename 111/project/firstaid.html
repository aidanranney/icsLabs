  <h1>Ski Safety - First Aid for Snowboarding & Skiing</h1>

Extreme sports are often synonymous to extreme excitement. But for every rush of adrenaline that one gets when he or she rides the Snowboard, there is a certain amount of risk of losing one's balance and falling down. The risk is magnified even more if one ventures out of the Snow Resorts and into the Backcountry.
There is more or less one snowboarder in his or her own and if an accident happens, help may not immediately be on the way.
We find it important, therefore, to introduce you to the different kinds of First Aid for the different kinds of accident that you or your companion might encounter in the outdoor. In that way, you will know how to respond to any possible situation given to you, instead of merely panicking.
