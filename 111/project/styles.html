	<h1> Adaptive Snowboarding</h1>
	Adaptive Snowboarding is the form of Snowboarding for people with physical disabilities.<br>
	<br>
	While many of them are amputees, there are also those who get into the sport and are victims
	of other disabilities like polio, cerebral palsy, and stroke. This sport offers hope to those
	who feel that their physical disabilities hinder them from taking any form of physical activity
	ever again in their lives. For those who may think that adaptive snowboarders cannot engage in
	the same boarding events as others, they are getting it wrong. In fact, adaptive snowboarders
	can participate in different events such as Bordercross, Slalom, Giant Slalom, Slopestyle and
	Halfpipe just like the others!<br>
	<br>
	That's just the beginning. As people and organizations try to
	develop new equipment in the sport, more and more people with specific needs will be able to
	participate in it. Although Adaptive Snowboarding has garnered enough attention from other
	snowboarders, the sport is still in its earliest stages of development. It may take a while
	before it gets included in the roster of games in the Winter Paralympic Games, but with the
	help of organizations willing to aid its development, it is not at all impossible for it to
	become a part of the world paralympic stage.<br>
	<br>
	One organization that aims to help in developing
	the sport is the Canadian Snowboard Federation (CSF). Some of its objectives include increasing
	awareness of the sport in Canada, coordinating with people who are willing to develop the equipment
	used in the sport, and assisting in the development of the sport in other countries. In the longer
	term, the CSF aims not only to help develop the sport in other countries but also to have programs
	in at least 10 countries on at least three continents.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, it aspires for the biggest form of
	recognition: to be included in the list of the Paralympic Winter Games. Since the sport is still in
	its infancy, the task of creating awareness about it as well as developing it into a real organized
	sport can be a daunting task. However, the prize lies in its eventual recognition in the world stage.
	In the end, as the awareness increases and more people get involved in this sport, more lives will be given hope and a new lease at life!

		<h1>FreeCarve or Alpine Snowboarding</h1>
		Carving is all about the speed and the ultimate carving turn in Snowboarding. This style normally takes place on hard pack or groomed runs. Although little or no jumping is required, this style usually carves powerful turns and graceful curves.<br>
		<br>The turns that are needed in the high-speed mountain descent will demand a lot of strength and concentration from the rider. Unlike Freeriding and Freestyle, Carving is not suitable for beginners because it is focused on the race and not on exploring the mountain.<br>
		<br>An Olympic Snowboarding event, such as the parallel giant slalom (modeled after ski racing), requires the racers to maneuver around gates or poles. Alpine riders use plate binding system and Hard Snowboard Boots, similar to Ski Boots, except that they are less stiff in the ankles. The boots are designed to have a shortened heel so as to lessen ankle movements during skid turns and to make the board much more stable at higher speeds and carved turns.<br>
		<br>An Alpine Snowboard is usually longer, narrower, and usually stiffer to give stability and edge-holding ability during high-speed descents.<br>
		<br>It is important to work on your speed in Carving since it is centered on the race as you descend the mountain slope. Always be aware of the track once you are at the moment of gaining higher speed. The exhilarating experience that you will feel in Carving or Alpine Snowboarding will make you beg for more of this sport.
